                <a href="live.html">Live</a>
                 week in the hospital.  He's out now and is improving, but further crisis issues have come to light.  Ed's house is in danger due to unpaid property taxes and he is being forced to divert what limited funds he has toward payment of those taxes.  The long-term plan is for Ed to sell the house and move into managed housing, but is immediate need is for supplemental funds to cover general expenses that he cannot afford to pay due to the tax burden.  Please help spread the word about this website and Ed's supplemental needs trust fund so we can generate more income in his time of need.  Other plans are also in the works to help reduce his living expenses and manage his finances on an ongoing basis, but in order to get there, he needs help NOW.  The Paypal link for online donations is at the bottom of this page.
